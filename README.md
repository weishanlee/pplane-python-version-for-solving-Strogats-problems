# pplane-python-version-for-solving-Strogats-problems
 python codes mimicking pplane to plot phase portrait for solving Strogatz's problems.
This program code intends to mimick the code of pplane in matlab and write python.
We only need to modify equations dx and dy in def eqnXDotYDot(x, y): 
Fixed points, nullclines, and direction fields are shown, and stability of fixed points are
also classified with linearization. Cautions are warned with borderline cases. Fixed points 
are represented with solid, hollow, or semi-hollow circles. Borderline cases that are not
able to determine the stability of fixed points are represented with question marks.
